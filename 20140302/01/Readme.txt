Program discription:
This program is designed for monitoring closing light to find out a way to close all lights in the matrix.

Rules of closing light:
Every you choose a light, the light being chosen and all other lights which in its four direct direction will be set to opposite state.

Note:
Actually, if the lights in the first line of the lights matrix are determined, other lights will be fixed. Because since the first line has been set absolute, the second line have to be set to make all lights in the first line in a off state. So we can deduce from this that all lights in this matrix will be determined by the lights in the first line.
